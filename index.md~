I am a Ph.D in bioinformatics, studying in school of computer science at [Harbin Institute of Technology][hit], Heilongjiang, China.

As a restless creature, I am very easily bored. 
I seek and try to create the funny things quite often, for example, I developed a [character matrix tool][zifuzi] particularly to amuse my friends on QQ (IM Software), drew a [snake picture][snake] use R at the China lunar new year`s eve (2013, the year of snake), simulated a poker game (named [fishing][fishing]) and analysed its principle.
Anyway, I also did some serious businesses, such as developed an [XeLaTeX dissertation template][template] for postgraduate degree of Northeast Forestry University. 


I dealt with biology and computer science a lot, and I happened to find out a problem which seriously troubles bioinformatics people.
Problem is , biology enlightens bioinfo guys that organisms are dying as time passing by while computer science simultaneously makes them know that code is immortal.

### 我
在读的计算机Ph.D，虔诚的学徒一只。  

<li>喜欢平静、优美的东西，例如`Monaco`字体、`LaTeX`、`Python`、`Sublime`。</li>
<li>喜欢编码、作图、研究有意思的数学。</li>
<li>喜欢做些搞怪的事，如做个QQ刷屏工具刷刷屏什么的。</li> 
<li>不爱干安装操作系统这类没啥新意的事，消耗生命。</li>


### 最近
忙于做点有趣也有益的事。

<li>做XeLaTeX毕业论文[模板](http://sdrv.ms/13MfJSN)</li>
<li>社交网上搞点自娱自乐的统计分析(ps:这个链接就不给出了，you know)</li>
<li>做点自动控制的工程</li>
