I am a Ph.D student in bioinformatics, studying in school of computer science at [Harbin Institute of Technology][hit], Heilongjiang, China.
As a restless creature, I am very easily bored. 
I seek and try to create the funny things quite often, for example, I developed a [character matrix tool][zifuzi] particularly to amuse my friends on QQ (IM Software), drew a [snake picture][snake] use R at the China lunar new year`s eve (2013, the year of snake), simulated a poker game (named [fishing][fishing]) and analysed its principle.
Anyway, I also did some serious and useful businesses (sort of), such as developed an [XeLaTeX dissertation template][template] for postgraduate degree of Northeast Forestry University, developed a [NCBI_GI2AGI][NCBI_GI2AGI] tool for College of Life Science of Northeast Forestry University. 
A couple of years ago, I majored in biology and not in the mood.
I think I am a biology student turned computer science student rather than bioinformatics student.
Currently my research interests include cancer bioinformatics, network biology.
